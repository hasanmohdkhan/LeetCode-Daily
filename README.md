# LeetCode Daily Solutions

## Overview

Welcome to your personal LeetCode journey! This repository is dedicated to documenting your daily progress as you tackle LeetCode problems. Here, you'll find solutions, explanations, and insights into problem-solving techniques, coding patterns, and data structure algorithms (DSA). Let's dive in!

## How to Use

1. **LeetCode Daily (LeetCode-150 and LeetCode-All):** Make it a daily habit to solve at least one LeetCode problem. Begin with the "LeetCode-150" directory, which contains solutions to the top 150 LeetCode problems, covering fundamental concepts. As you progress, move on to the "LeetCode-All" directory, where you'll find solutions to all LeetCode problems. Document your solutions here, and include comments explaining your thought process, time complexity, and any trade-offs made.

2. **Coding Patterns:** The "CodingPatterns" directory is a treasure trove of common coding patterns. Understanding these patterns is crucial for efficiently solving problems and writing clean, modular code. Apply these patterns in your LeetCode solutions and observe how they improve your efficiency.

3. **DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms):** Delve into the "DSA" directory to revisit and understand the implementations of various data structures and algorithms. Regularly revisiting these implementations will solidify your understanding and enhance your problem-solving skills.

## Repository Structure

1. **LeetCode-150:** This directory contains your solutions to the top 150 LeetCode problems. These problems are widely recognized as fundamental, covering a range of concepts and algorithms.

2. **LeetCode-All:** In this directory, you'll find solutions to all the LeetCode problems. This comprehensive collection will further deepen your understanding of various problem-solving approaches and help you explore different algorithms.

3. **Coding Patterns:** The "CodingPatterns" directory is a treasure trove of common coding patterns. Understanding these patterns is crucial for efficiently solving problems and writing clean, modular code.

4. **DSA:** The "DSA" directory houses implementations of essential data structures and algorithms. Regularly revisiting these implementations will solidify your understanding and enhance your problem-solving skills.

## Contribution Guidelines

Feel free to contribute by adding your own solutions, improving existing ones, or suggesting additional coding patterns and DSA implementations. Let's make this repository a collaborative space for learning and growth.
