Strings: 

1. Under the hood, strings are just an array of characters.
2. Like arrays, strings are variable in size. 
3. In most languages, strings are immutable.
    - making changes in string always create a new string causes space and time complexity
    - In Java, a StringBuilder is used to hold a stream of characters before converting
      it to a final immutable string(using .toString() method).

## Common Mistakes in Interviews Featuring Strings

1. Viewing String Problems As "Easy"
   - String is a linear data structure, All the algorithms and techniques related to
     linear data structures could potentially be involved in a string question.
   - This means techniques like
         ✅ two pointers
         ✅ sliding windows
         ✅ recursion
         ✅ backtracking
         ✅ dynamic programming
      (to name just a few) can be used in a string question.

   - Edge Cases and Interview Tips
     Be mindful of uppercase vs. lowercase characters.
     In ASCII, 'A' starts at 65 and 'a' at 97.

2. Advance algorithm in Strings
   The core algorithms to learn are:
     ✅ KMP
     ✅ Boyer Moore
     ✅ Rabin-Karp
